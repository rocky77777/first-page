		<h1>Hi, I'm Billy</h1>
		<h3>Introduction</h3>
		<div><p>I'm a Japanese to English translator living in Utsunomiya, Japan. I work mainly with an agency contracted by the local city government for legal translations. I also do lots of advertisements and business descriptions for local events and businesses.</p>
		<p>I love living in Japan. It's safe, peaceful, and disconnected from most of the world. For some people, that might be unsettling, but for me, it's perfect!</p></div>
